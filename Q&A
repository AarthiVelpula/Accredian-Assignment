Your task is to execute the process for proactive detection of fraud while answering following
questions.
1. Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinearity.
2. Describe your fraud detection model in elaboration.
3. How did you select variables to be included in the model?
4. Demonstrate the performance of the model by using best set of tools.
5. What are the key factors that predict fraudulent customer?
6. Do these factors make sense? If yes, How? If not, How not?
7. What kind of prevention should be adopted while company update its infrastructure?
8. Assuming these actions have been implemented, how would you determine if they work?
Here are the brief answers to the given questions:


1. Data Cleaning (Missing Values, Outliers, Multicollinearity):
- Missing values were addressed through imputation as needed.  
- Outliers were identified using the IQR method and either capped or removed as appropriate.  
- Multicollinearity was assessed with a correlation matrix and VIF. Variables exhibiting high multicollinearity were either eliminated or transformed.


2.Fraud Detection Model Description: 
- Models used were Logistic Regression and Random Forest.  
- Random Forest was selected for its superior ability to manage non-linearity and analyze feature importance.  
- GridSearchCV was employed for hyperparameter optimization.

3.Variable Selection Process: 
- RandomForest feature importance and correlation analysis were utilized.  
- Features with greater predictive power, such as transaction amount, time, and category, were retained.



4. Model Performance Demonstration: 
- Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  
- The ROC-AUC curve indicated high true positive rates and low false positive rates, reflecting strong model performance.



5.Key Factors Predicting Fraud:
- Transaction amount  
- Time of transaction  
- Merchant category  
- Customer behavior patterns  
- Location of transaction



6.Validity of Key Factors:
- The key factors make sense. Larger or atypical transactions frequently suggest fraud, and transactions occurring at unusual times or in high-risk merchant categories correspond with typical fraud patterns.

7.Infrastructure Updates for Prevention:
- Implement real-time monitoring of transactions.  
- Set threshold alerts for suspicious activities.  
- Establish a feedback loop to refine the model.  
- Conduct regular audits of fraud detection systems.



8.Monitoring the Effectiveness of Actions: 
- Monitor flagged transactions to track false positives.  
- Analyze customer feedback and fraud trends over time.  
- Update the model regularly based on new patterns to maintain performance.
